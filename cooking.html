<h2>Cooking</h2>

<p>
I'm a dad who cooks for his family. My love for cooking started early, watching my mom cook for us. My mother is a great cook. She learned how to cook from her mother and by feeding her family. She spoils our family with juicy roasted chicken, seasoned vegetables,
and hearty seafood soup. She taught me everything I know about cooking, like how to marinate a steak, tenderize it, and cook it just right.
<br>
<br>
It wasn't until I was grown that I appreciated her lessons in cooking. Cooking for my own family helped me remember all the things my mom had taught me.
Cooking a chicken meal for my son brings back memories of being in the kitchen with my mom. I remembered the little tips she taught me, like adding sugar in
a hot pan to give the chicken a dark, crispy skin. I still learn how to be a better cook from my mom. Someday I hope to
pass her recipes and advice to my son when he's old enough to cook for his own family.

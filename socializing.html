<h1>Socializing</h1>

<p> I used to think that I didn't have a hobby. I listen to music, watch tv, dance. One thing that I always look forward to and ease my stress
is socializing. I am an outgoing person. I love to spend time with people. I put together a group. We meet every saturday. We go to different places.
We meet each other's family and friends. We eat, drink, dance, and talk.. 
</p>
<p> It's not always joy because we sometime have to catch up on negative things that happened during the week. The best part of it is how better the positivity
of these woderful make me feel. We make sure that it is a non judmental invironment. I don't like to have fun alone. The more the better. We take trips together.
It's nice to meet other people when we go out. People always ask questions. Like how we met? Why are we so close? At the end of the day, hobby is what you find peace and
joy doing.</p>

<h2>The Electric Guitar</h2>

<p>The electric guitar is an iconic instrument. It has an unique and unmistakable sound. The electric guitar has been at the center of popular music for the last 100 years.
You can hear an electric guitar on a huge variety of records, from jazz to blues, to rock and hiphop. Its influence is so great that the masters of the guitar have become world famous musicians. Artists
like Django Reinhardt, Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen have all pushed the boundaries of what's possible with the instrument. 
<br>
<br>
How is it that the guitar has an unmistakeable sound, yet can blend in with so many different styles of music? It's because the electric guitar is a chameleon of an instrument. A guitar can sound wildly different in the hands of different guitarists. Its sound is shaped by the artist that plays it. 
This is how an electric guitar can go from sounding like a peaceful chime to a screeching banshee. This is the reason an electric guitar can be heard on everything from Miles Davis to Megadeth.

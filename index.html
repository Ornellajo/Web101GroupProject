<h2>The Electric Guitar</h2>

<p>The electric guitar is an iconic instrument with an unmistakeable sound. The electric guitar has been at center of popular music for the last 100 years.
From jazz to blues, to rock, to ballads, the electric guitar can be heard. The influence is so great that the masters of the guitar have become world famous musicians. Artists
like Django Reinhardt, Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen have all pushed the boundaries of what's possible with the instrument. 
<br>
<br>
The electric guitar is a chameleon of an instrument. The sound of instrument is shaped by the artist that plays it. Two identical guitars can sound wildly different in the hands of two different guitarists.
This is how an electric guitar can go from sounding like a peaceful chime to a screeching banshee.
